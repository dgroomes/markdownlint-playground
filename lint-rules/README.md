# lint-rules

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Custom lint rules for 'markdownlint'.

## Instructions

This package should be built and "packed" with the `npm pack` command so that it can be used by another local project; I
don't have a need to publish this to the npm Registry.

1. "Pack" the library 
   * `npm pack`

## Reference

* [Blog Post: *Testing npm packages before publishing*](https://medium.com/@vcarl/problems-with-npm-link-and-an-alternative-4dbdd3e66811)
  * This blog post makes a good case for the `npm pack` command in favor of `npm link`.
